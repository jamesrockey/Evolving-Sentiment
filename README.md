## Research Paper
For a detailed understanding of our methods and findings, please refer to our paper available here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.11.0: Our codebase is developed and tested on Python 3.11.0. Please ensure you're using a compatible version of Python.

### Setting Up the Environment
#### Create a Virtual Environment:
```

python3 -m venv tutorial-env
source tutorial-env/bin/activate
```
This will create and activate a new virtual environment named tutorial-env.

#### Install Dependencies:

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:


```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```
This will install all the necessary Python packages as listed in requirements.txt.

### Dataset
Our analysis uses a specific dataset of Bitcoin-related tweets. You can download this dataset from the following link: [Bitcoin Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets/data). Make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory as indicated in the code.

### Usage
After setting up the environment and downloading the dataset, you can run the Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository to replicate our analysis or to conduct your own research on the evolving sentiments in crypto markets.
